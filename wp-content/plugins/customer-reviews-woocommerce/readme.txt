Customer Reviews for WooCommerce plugin helps you get more sales with social proof. Set up automated review reminders and increase conversion rate.

== Description ==

Customer Reviews for WooCommerce plugin helps you get more sales with social proof. Encourage your customers leave product reviews and increase conversion of your store. This WooCommerce review plugin enables you to set up automatic review reminders for customers who recently purchased a product from your store. Reminder emails are sent to your customers inviting them to review the recent product(s) they purchased.

The plugin works as an interface to an external service for verification of customer reviews. The service called CR (Customer Reviews) facilitates collection of reviews from customers (including people who never bother to write reviews) and increases impact of reviews on purchasing decisions by verifying their authenticity. Information about terms, privacy, and data protection policies of CR is provided on [CR website](https://www.cusrev.com/business/).

Increase your store’s conversion rate by placing a “trust badge” on the home, checkout or any other page(s). Let customers feel more confident about shopping on your site by featuring a trust badge that shows a summary of verified customer reviews.

=== Structured Data Markup ===

Enhance the standard WooCommerce structured data markup with product identifiers (GTIN, MPN, Brand).

=== Integration with Google Shopping ===

* Generate an XML feed with products for Google Shopping
* Generate an XML feed with product reviews for Google Shopping and show star ratings in Google Shopping search results

=== Import Reviews ===

Add product reviews from external websites to your shop using WooCommerce import reviews feature. This feature will automatically create reviews in WooCommerce based on a CSV file.

=== How does it work? ===

The recommended way of using the plugin is as follows:

1. A customer makes a purchase from your online store.
2. You process their order and set status of the order as “Completed” (or other paid order status configured in the settings).
3. After a certain delay (configured in the settings), the customer will receive an email with an invitation to leave a review.
4. The customer writes reviews about products using a simple form hosted on an independent third-party domain (to remove suspicion that you could have created positive reviews yourself).
5. The reviews are transferred from the form to WooCommerce, saved to the database in the standard WooCommerce format, and published.
6. The customer (optionally) receives an email containing a discount coupon for future purchases in your store.

=== Prerequisites ===

To use this plugin, you should first do the following:

1. Install and configure WooCommerce
2. Enable customer reviews for product pages (they are enabled by default for new installations)

=== Pro Version ===

CR service has two plans: Free and Pro. The professional plan offers additional features and dedicated support by email. You can purchase a license for the Pro plan here: [official Customer Reviews (CR) website](https://www.cusrev.com/business/).

== Installation ==

1. Make sure that WooCommerce plugin is installed and activated. If it is not installed, install [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) first because it is necessary for this plugin.
2. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
4. Use the Reviews->Settings screen to configure the plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I found a bug in the plugin. How to get it fixed? =

Please create a new topic at the support forum and provide detailed information with a screenshot.

= How to get Site Key and Secret Key for reCAPTCHA? =

Please visit [reCAPTCHA website](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/start) and sign up for an account. Then, you will be able to get API key pair (Site Key and Secret Key) for your website. Copy these keys and paste into the settings of the plugin.

= Will collected reviews be shown as stars in Google? =

The standard WooCommerce functionality already includes structured data mark up to display your product reviews effectively within organic search results. This plugin extends the standard functionality and adds some extra mark up to help search engines properly crawl your shop. It is important to understand that having a valid structured data mark up in place makes your website eligible for organic stars in Google but it doesn't guarantee that they will be shown. You can test the rich snippets using [Google’s Structured Data Testing Tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool).

= How to customize template of the reviews on a single product page? =
The plugin uses the standard reviews template provided by WooCommerce and enhances it with the reviews summary bar. If your theme requires a customized reviews template or you would like to use a customized reviews template for some other reason, it is possible to do so. Here is how to do it:
1) Create a folder 'customer-reviews-woocommerce' in your current theme's folder.
2) Copy file 'ivole-single-product-reviews.php' from 'templates' subfolder in the plugin's folder to the folder created at step 1.
3) Customize the file 'ivole-single-product-reviews.php' in the current theme's folder according to your requirements.

= How to Change Sorting of Reviews? =
If you would like to change how reviews are sorted on product pages, it is possible to do so using the standard WordPress functionality. Go to Settings -> Discussion menu and find options “Break comments into pages with X top level comments per page and the last/first page displayed by default” and “Comments should be displayed with the older/newer comments at the top of each page”. You can control how reviews are sorted and displayed on product pages by modifying these options.
